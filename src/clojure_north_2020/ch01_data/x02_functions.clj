;; ## Manipulating Data and Building APIs with Functions
;; As a language, Clojure is great at working with data. It's very common once
;; you establish a data model to work with it interactively to build domain API
;; functions or just better understand the data. As you explore and find useful
;; relations it is common to "lift" a form into a function.
;;
;; ### Exercise: Interact with our data
;; Explore the data generated in the last ns and write a useful function.
;; Examples:
;;
;; * Find everyone with a given power.
;; * List the names of all characters that are the nemesis of someone with a
;; given power.
;; * Find the alias of the nemesis of everyone with an alias.
;; * Lift one of these explorations to a function.

;; ## Some Utility Functions
;; It is common to develop an data model and then bring in data from an external
;; source such as a csv file. You will then wish to conform this csv data to
;; your created internal model. We'll be doing this in the next few exercises so
;; that we don't have to create data for hundreds of supers by hand.
;;
;; We will be reading in our data from csv files. Let's write some functions for
;; converting our raw files into our data as we've modeled it previously. One of
;; the great things about Clojure is that is effectively a DSL for data, so the
;; functions we create now will be domain agnostic and of general utility in the
;; future since we're just dealing with data.
;;
;; ### Exercise: Write a csv->data function
;;
;; * Write a function that consumes a csv file and produces a sequence of maps
;;   for each entry in the file.
;; * Modify the function to convert column names to keywords. Tip: Clojure
;;   has the keyword function and the cuerdas library (included) has an even
;;   better one.
;; * Modify the function to trim string values.
;; * Modify the function to remove "garbage" values. If a key is empty or nil or
;;   a value is empty, nil, or "-", remove it from the map.
;;
;; Step 1: Inspect the data. We can see that the first row is the column names
;; and the rest are data. We also see some data quality issues:
;;
;; * The first column (index?) has no name
;; * Nonexistent values are "-"
;; * Nothing is done to parse non-string values

;; ### Other utility functions
;; This won't be an exercise, but here are a few more utility functions that we
;; will be using to parse our data.

;; ### Keywordize strings by:
;;
;;  1. replacing all sequences of nonword characters with a space
;;  1. Removing all single quotes
;;  1. Turning the string into a keyword using the 
;;  [Cuerdas](https://cljdoc.org/d/funcool/cuerdas/2020.03.26-3/doc/user-guide) library.
